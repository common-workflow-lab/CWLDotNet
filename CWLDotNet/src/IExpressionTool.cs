///
/// An ExpressionTool is a type of Process object that can be run by itself
/// or as a Workflow step. It executes a pure Javascript expression that has
/// access to the same input parameters as a workflow. It is meant to be used
/// sparingly as a way to isolate complex Javascript expressions that need to
/// operate on input data and produce some result; perhaps just a
/// rearrangement of the inputs. No Docker software container is required
/// or allowed.
