/// Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#SchemaDefRequirement
///
/// This field consists of an array of type definitions which must be used when
/// interpreting the `inputs` and `outputs` fields.  When a `type` field
/// contains a IRI, the implementation must check if the type is defined in
/// `schemaDefs` and use that definition.  If the type is not found in
/// `schemaDefs`, it is an error.  The entries in `schemaDefs` must be
/// processed in the order listed such that later schema definitions may refer
/// to earlier schema definitions.
/// 
/// - **Type definitions are allowed for `enum` and `record` types only.**
/// - Type definitions may be shared by defining them in a file and then
///   `$include`-ing them in the `types` field.
/// - A file can contain a list of type definitions
///
