/// Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#SecondaryFileSchema
///
/// Secondary files are specified using the following micro-DSL for secondary files:
/// 
/// * If the value is a string, it is transformed to an object with two fields
///   `pattern` and `required`
/// * By default, the value of `required` is `null`
///   (this indicates default behavior, which may be based on the context)
/// * If the value ends with a question mark `?` the question mark is
///   stripped off and the value of the field `required` is set to `False`
/// * The remaining value is assigned to the field `pattern`
/// 
/// For implementation details and examples, please see
/// [this section](SchemaSalad.html#Domain_Specific_Language_for_secondary_files)
/// in the Schema Salad specification.
