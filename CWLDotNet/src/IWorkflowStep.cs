/// Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#WorkflowStep
///
/// A workflow step is an executable element of a workflow.  It specifies the
/// underlying process implementation (such as `CommandLineTool` or another
/// `Workflow`) in the `run` field and connects the input and output parameters
/// of the underlying process to workflow parameters.
/// 
/// # Scatter/gather
/// 
/// To use scatter/gather,
/// [ScatterFeatureRequirement](#ScatterFeatureRequirement) must be specified
/// in the workflow or workflow step requirements.
/// 
/// A "scatter" operation specifies that the associated workflow step or
/// subworkflow should execute separately over a list of input elements.  Each
/// job making up a scatter operation is independent and may be executed
/// concurrently.
/// 
/// The `scatter` field specifies one or more input parameters which will be
/// scattered.  An input parameter may be listed more than once.  The declared
/// type of each input parameter is implicitly becomes an array of items of the
/// input parameter type.  If a parameter is listed more than once, it becomes
/// a nested array.  As a result, upstream parameters which are connected to
/// scattered parameters must be arrays.
/// 
/// All output parameter types are also implicitly wrapped in arrays.  Each job
/// in the scatter results in an entry in the output array.
/// 
/// If any scattered parameter runtime value is an empty array, all outputs are
/// set to empty arrays and no work is done for the step, according to
/// applicable scattering rules.
/// 
/// If `scatter` declares more than one input parameter, `scatterMethod`
/// describes how to decompose the input into a discrete set of jobs.
/// 
///   * **dotproduct** specifies that each of the input arrays are aligned and one
///       element taken from each array to construct each job.  It is an error
///       if all input arrays are not the same length.
/// 
///   * **nested_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
///       producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
///       output must be nested arrays for each level of scattering, in the
///       order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.
/// 
///   * **flat_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
///       producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
///       output arrays must be flattened to a single level, but otherwise listed in the
///       order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.
/// 
/// # Conditional execution (Optional)
/// 
/// Conditional execution makes execution of a step conditional on an
/// expression.  A step that is not executed is "skipped".  A skipped
/// step produces `null` for all output parameters.
/// 
/// The condition is evaluated after `scatter`, using the input object
/// of each individual scatter job.  This means over a set of scatter
/// jobs, some may be executed and some may be skipped.  When the
/// results are gathered, skipped steps must be `null` in the output
/// arrays.
/// 
/// The `when` field controls conditional execution.  This is an
/// expression that must be evaluated with `inputs` bound to the step
/// input object (or individual scatter job), and returns a boolean
/// value.  It is an error if this expression returns a value other
/// than `true` or `false`.
/// 
/// Conditionals in CWL are an optional feature and are not required
/// to be implemented by all consumers of CWL documents.  An
/// implementation that does not support conditionals must return a
/// fatal error when attempting execute a workflow that uses
/// conditional constructs the implementation does not support.
/// 
/// # Subworkflows
/// 
/// To specify a nested workflow as part of a workflow step,
/// [SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) must be
/// specified in the workflow or workflow step requirements.
/// 
/// It is a fatal error if a workflow directly or indirectly invokes itself as
/// a subworkflow (recursive workflows are not allowed).
///
