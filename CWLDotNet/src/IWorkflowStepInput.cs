/// <summary>
/// Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#WorkflowStepInput
///
/// The input of a workflow step connects an upstream parameter (from the
/// workflow inputs, or the outputs of other workflows steps) with the input
/// parameters of the process specified by the `run` field. Only input parameters
/// declared by the target process will be passed through at runtime to the process
/// though additonal parameters may be specified (for use within `valueFrom`
/// expressions for instance) - unconnected or unused parameters do not represent an
/// error condition.
/// 
/// # Input object
/// 
/// A WorkflowStepInput object must contain an `id` field in the form
/// `#fieldname` or `#prefix/fieldname`.  When the `id` field contains a slash
/// `/` the field name consists of the characters following the final slash
/// (the prefix portion may contain one or more slashes to indicate scope).
/// This defines a field of the workflow step input object with the value of
/// the `source` parameter(s).
/// 
/// # Merging multiple inbound data links
/// 
/// To merge multiple inbound data links,
/// [MultipleInputFeatureRequirement](#MultipleInputFeatureRequirement) must be specified
/// in the workflow or workflow step requirements.
/// 
/// If the sink parameter is an array, or named in a [workflow
/// scatter](#WorkflowStep) operation, there may be multiple inbound
/// data links listed in the `source` field.  The values from the
/// input links are merged depending on the method specified in the
/// `linkMerge` field.  If both `linkMerge` and `pickValue` are null
/// or not specified, and there is more than one element in the
/// `source` array, the default method is "merge_nested".
/// 
/// If both `linkMerge` and `pickValue` are null or not specified, and
/// there is only a single element in the `source`, then the input
/// parameter takes the scalar value from the single input link (it is
/// *not* wrapped in a single-list).
/// 
/// * **merge_nested**
/// 
///   The input must be an array consisting of exactly one entry for each
///   input link.  If "merge_nested" is specified with a single link, the value
///   from the link must be wrapped in a single-item list.
/// 
/// * **merge_flattened**
/// 
///   1. The source and sink parameters must be compatible types, or the source
///      type must be compatible with single element from the "items" type of
///      the destination array parameter.
///   2. Source parameters which are arrays are concatenated.
///      Source parameters which are single element types are appended as
///      single elements.
/// 
/// # Picking non-null values among inbound data links
/// 
/// If present, `pickValue` specifies how to picking non-null values among inbound data links.
/// 
/// `pickValue` is evaluated
///   1. Once all source values from upstream step or parameters are available.
///   2. After `linkMerge`.
///   3. Before `scatter` or `valueFrom`.
/// 
/// This is specifically intended to be useful in combination with
/// [conditional execution](#WorkflowStep), where several upstream
/// steps may be connected to a single input (`source` is a list), and
/// skipped steps produce null values.
/// 
/// Static type checkers should check for type consistency after infering what the type
/// will be after `pickValue` is applied, just as they do currently for `linkMerge`.
/// 
/// * **first_non_null**
/// 
///   For the first level of a list input, pick the first non-null element.  The result is a scalar.
///   It is an error if there is no non-null element.  Examples:
///   * `[null, x, null, y] -> x`
///   * `[null, [null], null, y] -> [null]`
///   * `[null, null, null] -> Runtime Error`
/// 
///   *Intended use case*: If-else pattern where the
///   value comes either from a conditional step or from a default or
///   fallback value. The conditional step(s) should be placed first in
///   the list.
/// 
/// * **the_only_non_null**
/// 
///   For the first level of a list input, pick the single non-null element.  The result is a scalar.
///   It is an error if there is more than one non-null element.  Examples:
/// 
///   * `[null, x, null] -> x`
///   * `[null, x, null, y] -> Runtime Error`
///   * `[null, [null], null] -> [null]`
///   * `[null, null, null] -> Runtime Error`
/// 
///   *Intended use case*: Switch type patterns where developer considers
///   more than one active code path as a workflow error
///   (possibly indicating an error in writing `when` condition expressions).
/// 
/// * **all_non_null**
/// 
///   For the first level of a list input, pick all non-null values.
///   The result is a list, which may be empty.  Examples:
/// 
///   * `[null, x, null] -> [x]`
///   * `[x, null, y] -> [x, y]`
///   * `[null, [x], [null]] -> [[x], [null]]`
///   * `[null, null, null] -> []`
/// 
///   *Intended use case*: It is valid to have more than one source, but
///    sources are conditional, so null sources (from skipped steps)
///    should be filtered out.
