/// Modify the behavior of CommandLineTool to generate a single string
/// containing a shell command line.  Each item in the argument list must be
/// joined into a string separated by single spaces and quoted to prevent
/// intepretation by the shell, unless `CommandLineBinding` for that argument
/// contains `shellQuote: false`.  If `shellQuote: false` is specified, the
/// argument is joined into the command string without quoting, which allows
/// the use of shell metacharacters such as `|` for pipes.
