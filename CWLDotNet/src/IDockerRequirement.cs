/// <summary>
/// Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#DockerRequirement
///
/// Indicates that a workflow component should be run in a
/// [Docker](http://docker.com) or Docker-compatible (such as
/// [Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/) and [udocker](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker)) container environment and
/// specifies how to fetch or build the image.
/// 
/// If a CommandLineTool lists `DockerRequirement` under
/// `hints` (or `requirements`), it may (or must) be run in the specified Docker
/// container.
/// 
/// The platform must first acquire or install the correct Docker image as
/// specified by `dockerPull`, `dockerImport`, `dockerLoad` or `dockerFile`.
/// 
/// The platform must execute the tool in the container using `docker run` with
/// the appropriate Docker image and tool command line.
/// 
/// The workflow platform may provide input files and the designated output
/// directory through the use of volume bind mounts.  The platform should rewrite
/// file paths in the input object to correspond to the Docker bind mounted
/// locations. That is, the platform should rewrite values in the parameter context
/// such as `runtime.outdir`, `runtime.tmpdir` and others to be valid paths
/// within the container. The platform must ensure that `runtime.outdir` and
/// `runtime.tmpdir` are distinct directories.
/// 
/// When running a tool contained in Docker, the workflow platform must not
/// assume anything about the contents of the Docker container, such as the
/// presence or absence of specific software, except to assume that the
/// generated command line represents a valid command within the runtime
/// environment of the container.
/// 
/// A container image may specify an
/// [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint)
/// and/or
/// [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd).
/// Command line arguments will be appended after all elements of
/// ENTRYPOINT, and will override all elements specified using CMD (in
/// other words, CMD is only used when the CommandLineTool definition
/// produces an empty command line).
/// 
/// Use of implicit ENTRYPOINT or CMD are discouraged due to reproducibility
/// concerns of the implicit hidden execution point (For further discussion, see
/// [https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.15140.1](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.15140.1)). Portable
/// CommandLineTool wrappers in which use of a container is optional must not rely on ENTRYPOINT or CMD.
/// CommandLineTools which do rely on ENTRYPOINT or CMD must list `DockerRequirement` in the
/// `requirements` section.
/// 
/// ## Interaction with other requirements
/// 
/// If [EnvVarRequirement](#EnvVarRequirement) is specified alongside a
/// DockerRequirement, the environment variables must be provided to Docker
/// using `--env` or `--env-file` and interact with the container's preexisting
/// environment as defined by Docker.
