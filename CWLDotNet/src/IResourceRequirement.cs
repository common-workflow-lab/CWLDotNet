/// "min" is the minimum amount of a resource that must be reserved to
/// schedule a job. If "min" cannot be satisfied, the job should not
/// be run.
/// 
/// "max" is the maximum amount of a resource that the job shall be
/// allocated. If a node has sufficient resources, multiple jobs may
/// be scheduled on a single node provided each job's "max" resource
/// requirements are met. If a job attempts to exceed its resource
/// allocation, an implementation may deny additional resources, which
/// may result in job failure.
/// 
/// If both "min" and "max" are specified, an implementation may
/// choose to allocate any amount between "min" and "max", with the
/// actual allocation provided in the `runtime` object.
/// 
/// If "min" is specified but "max" is not, then "max" == "min"
/// If "max" is specified by "min" is not, then "min" == "max".
/// 
/// It is an error if max < min.
/// 
/// It is an error if the value of any of these fields is negative.
/// 
/// If neither "min" nor "max" is specified for a resource, use the default values below.
