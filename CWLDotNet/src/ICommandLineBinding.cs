/// Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#CommandLineBinding
///
/// 
/// When listed under `inputBinding` in the input schema, the term
/// "value" refers to the the corresponding value in the input object.  For
/// binding objects listed in `CommandLineTool.arguments`, the term "value"
/// refers to the effective value after evaluating `valueFrom`.
/// 
/// The binding behavior when building the command line depends on the data
/// type of the value.  If there is a mismatch between the type described by
/// the input schema and the effective value, such as resulting from an
/// expression evaluation, an implementation must use the data type of the
/// effective value.
/// 
///   - **string**: Add `prefix` and the string to the command line.
/// 
///   - **number**: Add `prefix` and decimal representation to command line.
/// 
///   - **boolean**: If true, add `prefix` to the command line.  If false, add
///       nothing.
/// 
///   - **File**: Add `prefix` and the value of
///     [`File.path`](#File) to the command line.
/// 
///   - **Directory**: Add `prefix` and the value of
///     [`Directory.path`](#Directory) to the command line.
/// 
///   - **array**: If `itemSeparator` is specified, add `prefix` and the join
///       the array into a single string with `itemSeparator` separating the
///       items.  Otherwise first add `prefix`, then recursively process
///       individual elements.
///       If the array is empty, it does not add anything to command line.
/// 
///   - **object**: Add `prefix` only, and recursively add object fields for
///       which `inputBinding` is specified.
/// 
///   - **null**: Add nothing.
