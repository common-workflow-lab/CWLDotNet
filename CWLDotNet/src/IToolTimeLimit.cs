/// Set an upper limit on the execution time of a CommandLineTool.
/// A CommandLineTool whose execution duration exceeds the time
/// limit may be preemptively terminated and considered failed.
/// May also be used by batch systems to make scheduling decisions.
/// The execution duration excludes external operations, such as
/// staging of files, pulling a docker image etc, and only counts
/// wall-time for the execution of the command line itself.
