/// <summary>
/// Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#File
///
/// Represents a file (or group of files when `secondaryFiles` is provided) that
/// will be accessible by tools using standard POSIX file system call API such as
/// open(2) and read(2).
/// 
/// Files are represented as objects with `class` of `File`.  File objects have
/// a number of properties that provide metadata about the file.
/// 
/// The `location` property of a File is a URI that uniquely identifies the
/// file.  Implementations must support the `file://` URI scheme and may support
/// other schemes such as `http://` and `https://`.  The value of `location` may also be a
/// relative reference, in which case it must be resolved relative to the URI
/// of the document it appears in.  Alternately to `location`, implementations
/// must also accept the `path` property on File, which must be a filesystem
/// path available on the same host as the CWL runner (for inputs) or the
/// runtime environment of a command line tool execution (for command line tool
/// outputs).
/// 
/// If no `location` or `path` is specified, a file object must specify
/// `contents` with the UTF-8 text content of the file.  This is a "file
/// literal".  File literals do not correspond to external resources, but are
/// created on disk with `contents` with when needed for a executing a tool.
/// Where appropriate, expressions can return file literals to define new files
/// on a runtime.  The maximum size of `contents` is 64 kilobytes.
/// 
/// The `basename` property defines the filename on disk where the file is
/// staged.  This may differ from the resource name.  If not provided,
/// `basename` must be computed from the last path part of `location` and made
/// available to expressions.
/// 
/// The `secondaryFiles` property is a list of File or Directory objects that
/// must be staged in the same directory as the primary file.  It is an error
/// for file names to be duplicated in `secondaryFiles`.
/// 
/// The `size` property is the size in bytes of the File.  It must be computed
/// from the resource and made available to expressions.  The `checksum` field
/// contains a cryptographic hash of the file content for use it verifying file
/// contents.  Implementations may, at user option, enable or disable
/// computation of the `checksum` field for performance or other reasons.
/// However, the ability to compute output checksums is required to pass the
/// CWL conformance test suite.
/// 
/// When executing a CommandLineTool, the files and secondary files may be
/// staged to an arbitrary directory, but must use the value of `basename` for
/// the filename.  The `path` property must be file path in the context of the
/// tool execution runtime (local to the compute node, or within the executing
/// container).  All computed properties should be available to expressions.
/// File literals also must be staged and `path` must be set.
/// 
/// When collecting CommandLineTool outputs, `glob` matching returns file paths
/// (with the `path` property) and the derived properties. This can all be
/// modified by `outputEval`.  Alternately, if the file `cwl.output.json` is
/// present in the output, `outputBinding` is ignored.
/// 
/// File objects in the output must provide either a `location` URI or a `path`
/// property in the context of the tool execution runtime (local to the compute
/// node, or within the executing container).
/// 
/// When evaluating an ExpressionTool, file objects must be referenced via
/// `location` (the expression tool does not have access to files on disk so
/// `path` is meaningless) or as file literals.  It is legal to return a file
/// object with an existing `location` but a different `basename`.  The
/// `loadContents` field of ExpressionTool inputs behaves the same as on
/// CommandLineTool inputs, however it is not meaningful on the outputs.
/// 
/// An ExpressionTool may forward file references from input to output by using
/// the same value for `location`.
